# Cloud Computing and Devops Technologies ☁️
This repository contains notes and samples related to cloud computing using technologies such as Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS/Google Cloud.

## Terraform
#### Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool that enables users to define and provision infrastructure in a declarative manner. The following samples demonstrate how to use Terraform to provision resources in AWS:

> Sample AWS EC2 Instance: This sample demonstrates how to provision an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform.
> Sample AWS S3 Bucket: This sample demonstrates how to provision an AWS S3 bucket using Terraform.
> Sample Google Cloud Compute Instance: This sample demonstrates how to provision a Google Cloud Compute instance using Terraform.
> Sample Google Cloud Storage Bucket: This sample demonstrates how to provision a Google Cloud Storage bucket using Terraform.

## Docker
#### Docker is a platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. The following samples demonstrate how to use Docker:
> Sample Flask Application: This sample demonstrates how to build and run a Flask application in a Docker container.

## Kubernetes
#### Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The following samples demonstrate how to use Kubernetes:
> Sample Kubernetes Deployment: This sample demonstrates how to create a Kubernetes deployment for a Flask application.
> Sample Kubernetes Service: This sample demonstrates how to create a Kubernetes service for a Flask application.

## AWS/Google Cloud
#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud are cloud computing platforms that provide a wide range of services, including compute, storage, and database services. The following samples demonstrate how to use AWS and Google Cloud:
> Sample AWS S3 Bucket: This sample demonstrates how to create an AWS S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console.
> Sample AWS Lambda Function: This sample demonstrates how to create an AWS Lambda function using the AWS Management Console.
> Sample Google Cloud Storage Bucket: This sample demonstrates how to create a Google Cloud Storage bucket using the Google Cloud Console.
> Sample Google Cloud Functions: This sample demonstrates how to create a Google Cloud Function using the Google Cloud Console.
